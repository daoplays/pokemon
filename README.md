This is the source code for DaoPlays Pokemon.  Play through the original Pokemon Red as part of a DAO, with votes for the next move happening in real time with every new block, and raise money for a range of great charities!

The repo includes the code both for the main game app and the token launch app.  Each has a simple rust client, though we would recommend interacting with the apps through our website.  The game app also has a python directory containing the scripts used to stream the data from the block chain.
